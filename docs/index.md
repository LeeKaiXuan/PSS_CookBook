# Portable Test and Stimulus Standard (PSS) Cookbook

In this document, we summarize the LRM of PSS, and give you extra examples and tips.
Besides that, [AndesTech](https://github.com/andestech "Andes Technology") has build a simple DSL generator called PSSGen, which is open-source and free to use.
So most of the examples in this document are tested in PSSGen.
